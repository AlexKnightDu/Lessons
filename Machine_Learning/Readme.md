### Machine learning  
It's teached by TuShikui.  
Mainly talks about some important algorithms and principles in machine learning. 

- HW1 is around the k-means and Gaussian Mixture Models, also some competitive learning.
- HW2 is about PCA derivation, FA & ICA and causal discoveray algorithms. More math and more algorithms.
- HW3 is about SVM.
