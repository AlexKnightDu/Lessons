### Machine learning  
It's taught by TuShikui.  
Mainly talks about some important algorithms and principles in machine learning. 

- HW1 is around the k-means and Gaussian Mixture Models, also some competitive learning.
- HW2 is about PCA derivation, FA & ICA and causal discoveray algorithms. More math and more algorithms.
- HW3 is about SVM. SVM vs MLP, and SVM in image classification.
- Final is about mnist, but with noise. For there is another classmate in the project so there I just mention it without leaving the codes and report. The main idea is to remove the noise and reduce the Pan&Rotate. We used DFS to find the noise points and used PCA to find the correct direction of the character, which takes some increase but the final accurancy is still a little bit lower than the original mnist.
