### Machine learning and parallel computing (4J)
It's a engingeering creative practice curriculum (IV-J), taught by LvBaoliang.   
Mainly talking about the basic knowledge of machine learning and slightly about parallel computing.

- HW1 is about single neuronal perceptron also dip into tensorflow.
- HW2 is about Backpropagation algorithm, including derivation and manual implementation. Besides implement MLQP（Multilayer Quadratic Perceptron） algorithm based on the above and try to solve double helix classification （双螺旋分类） problem.
- HW3 is about SVM, one to one and one to rest, linear kernel and RBF kernel
- Final is about Min-Max algorithm from Teacher LvBaoliang.
